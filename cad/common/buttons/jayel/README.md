# Jay-El (Korry -style) switch replica

This particular replica is intended to be 
straightforward to manufacture with a CNC machine.

It aims to appear fairly realistic on the outside, but
the internals are significantly simplified from a real switch.

There are X main components:

* Outer sleeve that attaches to the panel. Slippery material like POM. 
* Slider that has two light isolated compartments for diffusers
* Diffusers that have text engraved on them
* Circuit board for SMD leds
* Connector that attaches to the led board and to the mechanical switch on the mainboard
